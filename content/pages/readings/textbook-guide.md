The most basic text is Mankiw's _Macroeconomics_. Krugman and Obstfeld's _International Economics_ is more applied to open economy issues, i.e., the focus on this course. King and King's _International Economics and International Economic Policy_ provides more advanced readings on particular topics (i.e., you need to have a strong grasp of the basics to really benefit from these essays).

\[Mankiw\] = Mankiw, Gregory. _Macroeconomics_. 6th ed. Worth Publishers, 2006. ISBN: 9780716762133.

\[K&O\] = Krugman, Paul, and Maurice Obstfeld. _International Economics: Theory and Policy_. 7th ed. Addison Wesley, 2005. ISBN: 9780321293831.

\[K&K\] = King, Philip, and Sharmila King. _International Economics and International Economic Policy: A Reader_. 4th ed. McGraw–Hill/Irwin, 2004. ISBN: 9780072873337.

None of these three texts are required, and you can do well in the course without looking at them. But for people who like to see more about the underlying theory or just to read more, these books are useful.

The matching between book chapters and topics/class sessions is as follows (keeping in mind that there is overlap and in many of our classes we repeat concepts already covered, as a way to build a broader understanding).
