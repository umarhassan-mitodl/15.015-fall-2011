Case Write–ups
--------------

The case write–ups should be brief, no more than 3 double–spaced pages. You may choose any 2 cases to analyze. Cases include both the traditional HBS cases and the other country issues discussed in some of the readings. Write–ups are due before class on the day the case is to be discussed. They are intended to be analytic discussions of some issue central to the case. Please do not write a précis of the case or repeat case facts except to bolster your argument. Based on the information provided in the case materials, please be analytically judgmental and evaluative. You should propose alternate macroeconomic views and action plans whenever appropriate and discuss the relevance and applicability of the frameworks proposed in the readings and lectures. In short, you should write what you think of the situation in the case and not merely what the author of the case says. Be original. These case write–ups are individual assignments.
